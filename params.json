AppCompatActivity\r\n>Base class for activities that use the support library action bar features.\r\n>You can add an `ActionBar` to your activity when running on `API level 7` or higher by extending this class for your activity and setting the activity theme to `Theme.AppCompat` or a similar theme.\r\n继承关系：\r\n```\r\njava.lang.Object\r\n   ↳\tandroid.content.Context\r\n \t   ↳\tandroid.content.ContextWrapper\r\n \t \t   ↳\tandroid.view.ContextThemeWrapper\r\n \t \t \t   ↳\tandroid.app.Activity\r\n \t \t \t \t   ↳\tandroid.support.v4.app.FragmentActivity\r\n \t \t \t \t \t   ↳\tandroid.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity\r\n```\r\n\r\n#2. mipmap folder\r\n>It’s best practice to place your app icons in mipmap- folders (not the drawable- folders) because they are used at resolutions different from the device’s current density.\r\n>\r\n\r\n#3. Toolbar\r\n>A standard toolbar for use within application content.\r\n\r\n>A Toolbar is a generalization of action bars for use within application layouts. While an action bar is traditionally part of an Activity's opaque window decor controlled by the framework, a Toolbar may be placed at any arbitrary level of nesting within a view hierarchy. An application may choose to designate a Toolbar as the action bar for an Activity using the setSupportActionBar() method.\r\n\r\n#4.

AppBarLayout\r\n>`AppBarLayout` is a vertical LinearLayout which implements many of the features of material designs app bar concept, namely scrolling gestures.\r\n\r\n#6.

Elevation - 升降光影效果\r\nhttp://developer.android.com/training/material/shadows-clipping.html#Elevation\r\n设置升降用elevation属性：\r\n`android:elevation=\"1dp\"` 或者 `View.setElevation() ` 方法\r\n`View.setTranslationZ()`方法\r\n`ViewPropertyAnimator.z()` and `ViewPropertyAnimator.translationZ()`动画可以加在切换的过程中。\r\n\r\n2. 自定义Activity切换动画\r\nhttp://developer.android.com/training/material/animations.html#Reveal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
